## my personal website 
*finally, the old portfolio was getting old!!*

----

### what is this?
i finally made a proper website about myself!! its an upgrade from a portfolio i used to have; it includes more of my personal
vibe/style, my hobbies, and my most recent projects.

### what does it contain?
it has 3 main sections:

- **home tab**: it's the first thing you see, and it includes some pictures, as well as a greeting (ofc!)
- **about me tab**: it includes information about me, my hobbies, and some fun facts!
- **showcase/projects tab**: it shows my main projects, a brief description, image, and it allows you to click and dive in!

### why? 
two main reasons:

one, i think the portfolio i had was WAYYY too simple, and it didn't represent me in any way. this one, on the other side, 
showcases not only my projects and skills, but also my vibe. and i feel like that's important. 

and two, i wanted to make a useful project for the athena award (a hack club initiative/YSWS for teenage girls and nonbinary folks),
and this seemed like a perfect project -- i needed it since a while ago and it kept me motivated enough to keep going and 
start adding up hours to join parthenon (a hackathon in nyc).

### how it works:
you have 3 htmls (home page aka index, about me and showcase), 3 css files (each for its respective html file) and one js file (for the sliding animation effect in the home page). they're all linked. as simple as that!

### some challenges and learning opportunities while doing this:
- **leaving tutorial hell** -- THIS IS SUPER IMPORTANT because sometimes we'll get stuck with tutorial projects. the idea is to try to figure stuff on your own, and add your own creative twists to projects!
- **no coding with AI** -- super big on this. on this day and age, a lot of us are super dependent on AI, even if it is just for debugging or for finding simple solutions. for this project, i decided to challenge myself and try to figure things on my own (aka. coding as i go and looking for ways to debug and improve things looking on forums)
- **making it look nice** -- this sounds weird, but i am not a design type of person. finding the right fonts, color palette, and overall design was hard, but i think i found a decent enough vibe. i already have some great resources for finding fonts and graphics for my future projects!
----

_thank you!!! i'll keep updating this as time goes by, as information changes and as i (and my vibe) change. any feedback and/or
suggestions would be highly appreciated!!_
